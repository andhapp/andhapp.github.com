title: Results not Efforts
---

If you cannot deliver the desired results you are just not good enough. One is judged not by his efforts but by the results he/she can produce which to me is a very bad situation to be in. I have been there several times because if you are making an effort why cannot you produce results??? If a striker cannot score he has lost the touch...he is written off...similarly for developers if you cannot produce desired results you are rubbish...

Now, the reason we have such a bizzare way to measure one's abilities is because good results rewards one with financial benefits, recognition in their work and excellent progress opportunities. On the other hand if you are putting 1000% precent of your effort and cannot produce a result you just better find a new career....

At the end of the day it comes down to...if you are not successful you are rubbish there is no middle layer you are either this side or that you cant possibly be both and results get you a seat on the successful side...
