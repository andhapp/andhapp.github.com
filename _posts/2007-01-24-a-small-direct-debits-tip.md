title: A small Direct debits tip
---

I had a trivial thought yesterday while walking towards the station...what if you change all your direct debits to go out of your account on the 1st of every month. I know a lot of people already do that but then there are a lot who do not. This will ensure that you know how much money you have every month for your own spending.

I know so many people who really do not know how to manage their money and end up paying (unfair) bank charges. This is a small tip that might be helpful.
