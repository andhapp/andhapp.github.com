title: Designer code meet

Do you write Designer code?

Well, this was the topic of [Chris Parsons's](<https://github.com/chrismdp>) ([eden developments](<http://edendevelopment.co.uk/>)) talk on Thursday evening. The presentation was top-notch and so was the exercise afterwards. I was lucky enough to pair up with [James Adams](<https://github.com/lazyatom>) (from [Go Free Range](<http://gofreerange.com/>)) and a ruby stalwart. We ended up refactoring some nasty piece of code into designer code pretty quickly. It was a really nice experience after all. If you would like to have a go then, it lives in Chris's [checkout-kata repository](<https://github.com/chrismdp/checkout-kata>) under [obfuscated branch](<https://github.com/chrismdp/checkout-kata/tree/obfuscated>).

The problem is our own [checkout problem](<http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html>), which I am sure you have come across before.
