title: Response from Netvibes team

In response to my [rant](/2008/06/29/netvibes-painful-experience.html), Francois from Netvibes team replied and suggested to use a url to [reset the cache](http://www.netvibes.com/?reset_cache=1)

I am assuming that it be used after one has moved stuff around to reset the cache and commit the recent changes.
