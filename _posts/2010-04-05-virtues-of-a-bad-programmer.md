title: Virtues of a Bad Programmer
---

In contrast to my earlier [post](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/2009/12/14/virtues-of-a-programmer/>).

I am no expert to judge people based on their programming skills. I am a n00b myself. However, I do try and move away from the n00b junction all the time. Anyways, these are the virtues of a bad programmer:

- **Laziness** \- OMG, who the hell is going to refactor this? Let us just duplicate code all over the shop. I can't be asked to go over the old code and ensure it can accommodate new business requirements. I will just leave it like this and let someone else worry about it.
- **Impatience** \- I am not going to google for 2 hours to find a solution to the problem. Neither will I spend time looking through this open source code to fix the issue. Instead, I will cut corners and try and make a business case out of it. I have no patience to upgrade to the latest version since that breaks my existing code and I am not bothered to look through the issues and fix them.
- **Hubris** \- Clean code? It works man! I do not care if it's a nightmare for the next guy, my job is to get it to work. It works and that's what matters.
