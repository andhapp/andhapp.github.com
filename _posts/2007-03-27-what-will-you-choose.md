Last week my brother booked an appointment with the hairdressers and showed up 15 minutes late...the hairdresser simply refused to cut his hair not because he was annoyed due to his lateness...he instead made a simple request to my brother to rebook.

He had a perfect reason to do so. He had another appointment in 15-20 minutes and he did not want to rush into cutting my brothers hair. He simply said, I will not enjoy it.

Now there are two debatable issues here:

Do you think it was bad customer service to turn down a customer?

Do you think he actually lost a customer (my brother in this instance)?

Not at all, he was actually being honest and made it clear that his topmost priority was to make his customers happy and he drew tremendous satisfaction from that. He could have just cut my brothers hair, made the money and not bother with customer satisfaction. Tell me one thing will you not prefer to visit a place that treats you well...

Sometimes its about the customers and not the money, lot of companies do that but there are lot more who do not!
