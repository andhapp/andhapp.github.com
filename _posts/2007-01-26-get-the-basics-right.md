title: Get the basics right
---

I saw [Gordon Ramsay's](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay>) [Kitchen Nightmares](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay's_Kitchen_Nightmares>) for the first time...thanks to [Richard](<http://www.ur-ban.com>). It made me realise two simple things:

1) Get the basics right. You make your way up from the bottom there is no shortcut to get to the top...so get the basics right and then work your way up...<br>

 2) Never get a job by lying about your abilities... because sooner or later the truth will come out.
