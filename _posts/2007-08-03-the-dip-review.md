title: The dip - Review
---

For the first time ever I have finished reading a book in a weekend. "The dip" by Seth Godin is a good read and very short (less than 100 pages). Reason behind it being so short is to do with relevance, to the point no extra baggage, no repetition and therefore extremely interesting.

Seth Godin is quite remarkable in picking up simple notions and expounding them in a distinguished manner. The dip revolves mainly around the idea of quitting. I would not dare to go in fine details. Most of the things he talks about in the book are simple things which lot of people either ignore or do not realise. And to be honest I have heard his whole theory on quittinq before from my elders in a different form but the evaluation is the same.

But quitting is not an easy decision to make end of the day but my suggestion is to look at the bigger picture, visualise next 10 years and it takes a lot of effort and commitment. Rome was not built in a day...
