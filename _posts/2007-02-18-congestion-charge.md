title: Congestion charge
---

My ferret for articles related to recent congestion charge debate led me to few of these published back in 2003. These articles do not highlight the usual besetment; they rather ostentatiously describe "congestion charge" as the harbinger of good. I am not sure if the writers of these articles in the present day still maintain the same opinion or not (that will remain a mystery to us)

I know you do not believe me so here are the links: [Article 1](<http://www.trendsetter-europe.org/?ID=1016>), [Article 2](<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article881365.ece>), [Article 3](<http://www.ft.com/cms/s/69740444-682d-11d9-a11e-00000e2511c8.html>) and there are ad infinitum articles sharing the same notions.

So if the successful adoption and running of this system is setting an exemplary example then what is Londoners complaining about? Well the answer is simple and is evident from the questions and answers below:

1) When car prices go up do people stop buying cars? NO!!!

2) When alcohol becomes expensive do people stop drinking? NO!!!

3) When train fare is hiked do people stop travelling? NO!!!

So...I am not sure if the new congestion charge prices will for real stop people from commuting to work (in other words reduce the congestion) but it has certainly affronted the people.
