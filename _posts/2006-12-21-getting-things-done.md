title: Getting Things Done
---

Following my post [Planning + Organisation = GTD?](/2006/12/06/planning-organisation-gtd-aka-gettingthingsdone.html) my mentor [Richard](<http://www.ur-ban.com>), suggested me to read [David Allen's "Getting Things Done - stress free productivity"](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280) book. I have read the first part in the book and I am completely flabbergasted by my ignorance to trivial details.

Few years back I was habitual of jotting down my To-do list on a piece of paper and keep it in my wallet. I glanced over that list every now and again to ensure everything on my mind was there which relieved me off the stress. I only realised that after reading David Allen's book that if things are on your mind you are bound to get distracted ([D-factor](/2006/12/06/planning-organisation-gtd-aka-gettingthingsdone.html), I guess). I totally revere the guy now.

My aim is to read the book and use his expertise to devise my own way of keeping a sort of diary as he stresses on the fact that "as far as it is off your mind... you will be composed and focussed for your task".
