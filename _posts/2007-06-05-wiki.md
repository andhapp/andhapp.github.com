I am thinking of starting my own wiki...Richard has already done it and sounds like a good idea ...come handy when you cannot remember how you solved this problem last time... just look it up on wiki so I might do it.

My only reservation however is that I will just not update it after a while... which will defeat the whole purpose of creating it in the first place....I think I should reconsider it....
