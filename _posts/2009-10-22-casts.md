I wonder did Ryan bates start a revolution by doing ([RailsCasts](<http://railscasts.com>)) his short videos on various ruby concepts because there is a [BDDCasts](<http://bddcasts.com>) and today I saw [GitCasts](<http://gitcasts.com>) on [Git's](<http://git-scm.com>) main site. It is in the same fashion a collection of short videos on Git concepts but they are damn helpful, I tell you.

**Update: ** Found another [site](<http://www.teachmetocode.com/>) with screencasts on various ruby and rails concepts.
