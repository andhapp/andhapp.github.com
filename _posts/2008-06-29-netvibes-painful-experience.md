title: Netvibes - painful experience
---

I have been using Netvibes Feed Reader for over a year now and never had any issues with it. I have enjoyed the convenience of keeping an eye on the popular blogs and feeds.

But it all changed a couple of days ago...I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to move some of the feeds around with an intention to organise it in a better way. I added new tabs (groups) and moved stuff around. I refreshed the browser after finishing the rearrangement and none of the recent changes were saved for some reason. All the feeds were categorised in the "Lost and Found" section and all other sections that I had created just disappeared.

I was absolutely perplexed and I had to go through all my feeds again and sort them out into different categories...let me tell you this it was painful and tedious. Well I got home and opened up my Netvibes and there is a whole list of the tabs that I created in the afternoon along with the old ones for some reason. so I had to delete the duplicate sections and sort it out again. I have not been back to work yet and I just hope that it is not all messed up again.

I have sent my feedback to the Netvibes team and I hope they would fix this issue or atleast let me know if it was a user error.
