title: The Art of Interviewing
---

Interviewing is surely an art!

Appropriate questions coupled with a prudent approach will do the job. But, then how many interviewers do it properly. Here's some of the wisdom I'd like to share:

\* A 5-min phone conversation is not enough evidence to prove if a programmer is fit for the team.

\* A whiteboard exercise to solve a technical test is an API memory test and should be banished.

\* Whiteboard is good for discussing technical architectures and that's exactly what it should be used for.

\* Giving a tough maths question to solve as a technical test is not going to reveal a candidate's understanding of HTTP protocol. Keep things relevant to the job.

\* Follow KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) principle. Programmers like to program. So, give them a relevant problem and a computer and let them do what they like to do.

\* Not remembering the entire programming language API is not a bad thing unless you work in a bunker, cut off from the rest of the world.

That's all for now.
