title: When Safari 5's Reader feature fails
---

Safari 5 is awesome and one thing that sticks out is the Reader feature. It basically identifies some pages, for example: news pages on BBC, and allows user to produce a better, enhanced page with same text but much readable than before and devoid of any ads or pictures. But it fails badly [here](<http://wiki.github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/examples>). If you are on Safari 5 and click the link and then click the READER button in the address bar, you'll agree with me.

Well, apart from one odd example, I think it works brilliant. I just thought I will point it out that it should identify the code blocks with pre or code tags and format them accordingly.
