title: Some useful git commands
---

gitHub is an amazing piece of functionality. The user interface is so amazing that BitBucket simply ripped it off. Yes, without any regrets. I mean people are bound to notice that sort of stuff but still these things happen. Anyways, I came across some really handy git commands and would like to share them and just make a record of it in case I need to refer to them.

1.  [git daemon](<http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html>)
2. [git instaweb](<http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git-core/docs/git-instaweb.html>)
3. [git shortlog](<http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-shortlog.html>)
