title: Issues with webrick startup
---

**Issue** \- Everytime I created a project and tried to start the Webrick server I got an error message something like issue with the gem:main\_object (seriously cannot remember). I did a bit of googling but could not get my hands on any useful resources.<br>

**Solution** \- Do a fresh installation of ruby and rails and the issue just disappears I am not exactly sure what was causing it but it was very frustrating....
