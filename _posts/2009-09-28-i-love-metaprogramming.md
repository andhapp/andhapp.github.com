title: I love metaprogramming
---

I have almost finished the 80% of ruby metaprogramming course and I am loving it. Really, writing a complete class without writing the code below. This is so old way of writing code...nah just kidding.

<pre>class People
end
</pre>

Also, declaring the instance methods and using class\_eval just obfuscates the code. Awesome. I will share the code here once I have finished it.
