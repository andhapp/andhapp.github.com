title: CSS in IE7
---

I noticed CSS's bizzare behaviour yesterday...discussed below.

Situation: I have a nested unordered list so something like:

```
begin ul

begin li

end li

begin ul

 begin li

end li

end ul

end ul

```

Rule that worked in both IE7 and Firefox:

```
ul ul li {

} //which makes perfect sense

```

But for some reason IE7 behaves in the same manner if I amend the above rule as below which is incorrect.

```
ul li ul li {

} // I discovered this one accidently
```

I thought IE7 treated CSS properly...I guess it is still not as good as Firefox...
