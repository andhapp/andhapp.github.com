title: Bundler 1.0.0.beta.5 and Rails 2.3.8
---

I wrote about [Bundler](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/2010/06/03/bundler-and-rails-238/>) a couple of months ago. With newer versions of bundler out two of my issues at that time, using engines and issues with time\_zone have been resolved. I am currently using bundler 1.0.0.beta.5 with a rails 2.3.8 application. I know I should just move it to Rails3 and yes that is in the pipeline and hopefully very soon.
