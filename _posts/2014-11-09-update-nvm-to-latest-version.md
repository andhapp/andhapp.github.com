title: Update NVM to latest version
---

A very quick post as a reminder to self.

Running the install script for nvm like this will update nvm if it's installed already.

<pre>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.18.0/install.sh | bash
</pre>

I had to trawl through few links to find this solution and don't forget to change the version number in the command.
