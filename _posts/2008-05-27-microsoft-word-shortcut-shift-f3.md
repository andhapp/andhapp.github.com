title: Microsoft Word Shortcut (Shift + F3)

Do you know what this is used for??

Well I did not know that you could do this in microsoft word but apparently the use of Shift + F3 cycles through different types of cases so it would change the selected text from all uppercase to all lowercase to camelcase and so on.
