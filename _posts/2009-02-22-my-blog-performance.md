title: My blog performance
---

On Friday, I tested the performance of my blog and it turns out it is not that bad but there is still room for improvement. On Saturday, I was searching for something and stumbled across this [link](<http://www.webslug.info/index/view/id/1657/bbc.com//t/battle//andhapp.com>) which gives a breakdown of my site's performance. Apparently, my site was involved in four performance battles and won one.

I cannot remember the name of the site I conducted this test on....I am losing it...seriously but atleast my site isn't...

Update: I found the site. It is called [Load Impact](<http://loadimpact.com/>). Go check it out...
