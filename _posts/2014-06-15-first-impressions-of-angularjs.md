title: First impressions of AngularJS
---

Do you care about view markup in your applications?

I do to an extent that anything, even slightly, untidy leaves be deflated. Then one day, I had to work with this AngularJS application, and it was overwhelming, at least.

AngularJS builds on the promise of improving the HTML markup and making it more expressive. However, my first impression was ‘What the hell is this mess!’. My friends, don’t judge a book by its cover, so I still gave my best shot and dug a bit deeper to find out that it’s not bad. To be honest, it’s quite powerful and expressive, and for what it provides with this nice little framework is pretty cool. It’s quite similar to another framework from Google guys, called, Polymer.

I have only touched the surface of AngularJS and once I let my first impressions go, I could see the power beneath the surface. I will be working with it more in the near future and post my thoughts on it again.
