title: One question on Stack Overflow
---

After 73 days of minimal activity I asked my first question (more about the question in another post) on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and in just one day:

* My reputation has gone up from 1 to 83.
* I have earned two badges - Student and Scholar.
* and have an increased proclivity towards the site.

However, it is nothing compared to the top person on the site who has in access of 17000 reputation points and 92 badges. Some people have way too much time on their hands.
