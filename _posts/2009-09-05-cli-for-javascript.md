---

No way... I do not believe you. What? There is a command line interface for Javascript which you can access as easily as your browser or any other app for that matter. I cannot believe that I did not know about this till today but I am glad I found out. Right, so the credit goes to our friends over at [Ajaxian](<http://ajaxian.com/>) who over the past years have invested time in bringing out some creative and interesting news features from the world of Javascript and CSS. Well, head over to their site via this [link](<http://ajaxian.com/archives/javascript-on-the-command-line-or-as-a-shell-scripting-language>) and educate yourself.
