title: Firefox delicious Add-on
---

I have had this in my mind for ages but never had the opportunity or time to blog this. I love delicious bookmarks - its simple and succinct. However, there is one small shortcoming that I have noticed and I was hoping it would come in the later versions but nope its not there. In order to bookmark and tag a webpage one needs to use Cmd + D (or Ctrl + D for PC) to bring up the delicious window where one can fill in the details and select the recommended tags. Now wouldn't it be handy if next to the tags there be a small button which says "Select all tags" or just "all" because I really do not fancy clicking on each one. Imagine if you want to add 10 from that list or if you want to add all of them.

I hope they add it in the next version.
