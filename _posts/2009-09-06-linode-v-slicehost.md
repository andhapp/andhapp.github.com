title: Linode v Slicehost
---

Internet is the most exciting invention of its times. Over the years it has saved me countless hours. Here is another example. I have been contemplating a move to VPS hosting and instantly Slicehost and Linode springs to my mind. But like any other human being, this blue pill or red pill (see the matrix or not) thing is a pure hassle. Thankfully, unlike Matrix we can run scientific tests to evaluate the better out of the two in the present situation. Well, here's an article I found by [David](<http://journal.dedasys.com/2008/11/24/slicehost-vs-linode>) which explains in details the advantages and disadvantages. It's a very impressive statistical work and I suggest you do read it. However, there is one downside that the article was written back in November, 2008 and 10 months is a long period so you might want to check out the current state of affairs before taking the plunge.
