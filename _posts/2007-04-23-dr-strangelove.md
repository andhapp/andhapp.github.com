[Dr. Strangelove](<http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/>) \- If you have not seen it then you are actually missing a lot...quite hilarious and satirical...

Really worth watching....

Pure coincidence is I read this [article](<http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1346632.0.humans_in_secret_radioactive_tests.php>) in the morning....
