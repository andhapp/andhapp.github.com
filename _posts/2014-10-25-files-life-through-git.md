title: File's life through Git
---

I realised a few months ago that I should read more books. I have a ton of them. I could never read all of them unless I start now. The first one I ended up reading was a short book on [git](<http://git-scm.com/>). It was quite basic except for a couple of striking things. One of them is this image I found on a blog that clearly and closely depicts the journey a file may take travelling from your working directory to the destination repository.

Any seasoned Git user will know this by heart, but, it is still a very concise representation of [git's](<http://git-scm.com/>) transport commands and the actual journey. By the way, Index is also known as Staging, just in case you get confused with terminology on Google.

I hope it helps new git users to get used to the process and the various stages.
