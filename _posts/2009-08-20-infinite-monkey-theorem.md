title: Infinite Monkey Theorem
---

I found out about this mathematically proven concept in an article and had to blog about it. You can read it for [yourself](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem>)...I found it absolutely hillarious. I have actually read about this before in Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book [Fooled by randomness](<http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets/dp/0141031484>) but it was used in a very loose fashion with no references to the actual name. Now, I can just regurgitate the name without having to explain the whole concept. Great.
