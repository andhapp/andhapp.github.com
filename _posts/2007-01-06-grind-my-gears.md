I do not understand why customer facing organisations run without any prior resource planning. For some reason all the bank employees were participating in some mass exodus at about 13:30... or they were just busy not doing anything...contemplate the following scenario:

1\. Only two cashiers are serving in a bank with a capacity of eight...

2\. One window has been allocated for money exchange purposes but I am sure they can all carry out the usual services when it is unoccupied...

3\. One is kept free to look after the business customers...

4\. Then there are two staff members chatting in one corner as apparently they are personal bankers so they won't come and dirty their hands in petty cashiers job...

Conclusion: I queued up **15-20** minutes for a **2 **minute job...

Does this bank need any further **competition**?? The answer is no...it does not because it is actually competing against itself by driving its customers away. I am not sure how can these customer-centric organisations completely ignore the most important entity - "Customers".

As far as resource planning goes, it is a known fact that majority of people use their lunch hour to perform the miscellaneous bank transactions and I would have imagined the banks are astute enough to lunch around those times as opposed to during those times....but unfortunately I am wrong.
