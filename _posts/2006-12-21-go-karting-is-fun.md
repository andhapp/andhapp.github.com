title: Go Karting is fun
---

The other day I got an opportunity to try my hand at [Go Karting](<http://www.theraceway.net/>) and was totally outclassed by my work colleagues. I put up a dismal performance...not far behind from England's performance in the last Ashes Test. I did jump two places up in the second round which was the only bright side about it. Also it was great fun...absolutely mind blowing. I will definitely go back very soon...in the end there was an award ceremony.

Last but by no means least we were handed out our performance graphs, bar charts and what not which gave all of us enough to talk about for next few hours....or probably few days...
