title: Register a new library with Bower
---

Well, this is really a note for self because I tend to remember things better if I write them down and what better place than my blog. So, whenever you register a library with bower, please don't forget to create a tag in the remote repository for that version. Bower uses the version to pull the library down from the tagged version in the remote repository on installation.

I've been spending time trying to write a PhoneGap application, and bower is kind of bundler for the Javascript world.
