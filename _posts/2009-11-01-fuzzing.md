Read about this technique of testing called [Fuzz testing](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing>) or Fuzzing whilst reading Zed Shaw's [essay](<http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/ragel_state_charts.html>) on Ragel, the state machine compiler. It is quite interesting stuff really once you get a hang of it.
