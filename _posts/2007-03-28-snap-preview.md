title: Snap preview

Yes...finally I have removed the Snap previews from my site. I just wanted to test it and see it working and to me its just another way to distract the users. At this point I do not see what its trying to accomplish...

These are my opinions I am sure there are snap preview lovers out there ... similarly there are zillions of myspace lovers out there and I just find it another way to waste time...my opinion after all...
