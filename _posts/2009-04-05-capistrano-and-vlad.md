title: Capistrano and Vlad
---

I have a bad news to share...Vlad the deployer does not work on Windows. Sad news for me atleast. Well I had used Capistrano for deployment on [Epoxy](<http://epoxy.andhapp.com/>) Ubiiquity command and seriously wanted to use Vlad and see if the claim "that it is easier" holds any water. But guess what it does not work on Windows. My shenanigans [continue](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/2009/03/29/cygwin-rspec-on-windows/>). Well, I do not blame them for not keeping Windows as their priority. The chart below pretty much highlights the fact that there are not that many rails developer working with windows.<br>

 But I hope they would sooner rather than later will release a Windows compatible version and I would be able to get my hands dirty or may be I should just get a Mac.
