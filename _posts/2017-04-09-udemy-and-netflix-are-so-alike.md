title: Udemy and Netflix are so alike!
---

Two different, but somewhat related fields have seen exponential growth in the last few years.

Online learning platforms and On-demand movies/box sets/videos platforms.

To be fair, there aren't that many of them, but 'exponential growth' makes it more dramatic and that's the effect I am going for.

Udemy, Netflix, Coursera, Amazon Prime, blah, blah, blah.

But, why are you subjected to this universal and mundane information? You know there are online learning platforms, you also know there are online movies platforms, so what's the point.

Well, the point is an epiphany that I had whilst "~~enjoying my daily commute to work~~" watching a course on Udemy.

I realised that Udemy and Netflix are so alike!

Here's the reason why.

Because a tiny percentage of the content on these platforms is just pure gold and the rest is *utter rubbish*.

So, the challenge then is to separate the wheat from the chaff.
