title: Yahoo mail is...
---

I moved to Google mail last year and it is the best email service I have ever used. It was at the same time Yahoo rolled out its new features which takes absolutely ages to come to life something that has annoyed me so much as I do log onto my old yahoo account every now and again...if you are running a moderate speed internet then be prepared to get frustrated as you will have to put up with a lot of crap...

Anyways...recently I tried to access gmail and discovered a useful feature...a service offered by gmail which simply gives user a choice to load a basic HTML mail interface as opposed to the normal one. This feature gets invoked if you are using a slow internet connection...good thinking I am sure there are people out there who do not use ultra fast internet.
