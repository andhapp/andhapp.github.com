title: Ruby 1.9
---

I was looking for the hash syntax in Ruby 1.9 as I could recollect that it has changed but did not remember it exactly and discovered [this site](<http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?Changes+in+Ruby+1.9>) that has all the changes in Ruby 1.9 in one place and in order. I know you can read "[Programming Ruby 1.9](<http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356085>)" by [Dave Thomas](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_%28programmer%29>) but then again this site would be extremely handy when you are upgrading your gems to Ruby 1.9. I wonder how many people have actually started using ruby 1.9. I do have it installed as a different [binary](<http://wonko.com/post/how-to-compile-ruby-191>) (ruby19) but I have not been using it really.
