title: Spammers have grown up
---

Getting spam in your e-mail or via comments on your blog is not a new thing. I do it all the time and mine is not even a popular blog and in my case Akismet has caught `20268` up till today. Imagine GigaOm for that matter, they must be bombarded with spam all day long. However, the spam messages have improved over the years and they are no more `Viagara`, or `Enlarge your ...` but they are carefully selected and polite. For instance, see below the last couple of spam messages I 've received on this blog:

> "How long has this blog been around? I have been searching for this kind of information for the past week and a half."


> That rss feature on your website here is brilliant, you should tell more folks about it in your next post. I haven't noted it a first, now I'm using it each morning to check on any updates.

They are so soft and nice and I am actually tempted to just accept them just to show how popular my blog is. So, spammers have grown up and gone are the days of nasty spam messages. There might be a few odd ones that fall through Akismet's trap but the nice once always come through. I have no idea about this shift in the trend but I don't mind it because it is better to read a nice message before you reject it then a nasty one.

**Update**: Yet another nice message from the spammers who found this blog. But the contents of the message are legit and polite. Here it is:

> This is truly a greatwebsite. I've a few myself. I truly love your format. I understand this is off subject however,did you make this design your self,or buy from a social networking site?
