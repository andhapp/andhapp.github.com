I just noticed a new functionality on Wall Street Journal's site...if you select a word, or phrase, or sentence, or paragraph and right click on it a new box opens up in addition to the default Right click menu...which shows the search result of the phrase you right clicked on. The search is restricted to Wall Street Journal's online material only. I read about this kind of functionality somewhere but I cannot remember it now.

Anyways try it yourself...[Wall Street Journal.](<http://online.wsj.com/public/us>)

I am not very sure if this is actually used because I discovered it accidently as I never use the right click to copy things I am a keyboard person...but I am sure people who frequent on Wall Street Journal do use the right click.
