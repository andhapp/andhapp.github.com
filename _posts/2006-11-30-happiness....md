Are you happy?

If Yes - then you are a good man.

If No - really, why not? What makes you unhappy?

I always thought that if I lose weight I will be happy or if I get good marks I will be happy. That does not mean that I was not happy when I did achieve those milestones but I was happy for a day or two and third morning I got up I was same as I was before and that first day feeling - Wow!, I am not FAT anymore, changed to, so what I am not FAT.

Well, all these small achievements must make you happy but one main thing that will always keep you happy is your attitude towards life. How do you deal with a particular situation in life? I say - It is all in your mind. The moment you adopt the half glass full (and not the half glass empty) way of looking at life you will be happy. Do not look at all the things you failed at but at the things you have achieved. Look at the bright side of your Life and be grateful for what you have.

Some people are of the idea that if I will be rich I will be happy. But money can buy you a bed, can it buy you sleep. The answer is NO. But does that mean we should not work hard to earn more, of course not. Earn money to live a comfortable life, but do not live your life to earn money.

How do you feel about this statement?

I am not unhappy because I could not achieve this but I am unhappy because someone else could (like friend or colleague at work).

I hope that is not the case with you and if it is then you better change yourself today as this will not take you anywhere.
