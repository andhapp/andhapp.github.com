title: Success and time available are directly related
---

Going back to [Trizle's](<http://www.trizle.com/how-to-never-fail/>) post where [I got mentioned](<http://www.trizle.com/how-to-never-fail/#comments>) by very kind Andrew... I believe that being able to accomplish a task (which in this context is referred to as 'Success') has a close relationship with the time available to do that task because sometimes one is completely stuck in something which takes longer than expected and was never contemplated originally.

Therefore, saying "you will never fail" actually implies that you have enough motivation left after so many unsuccessful attempts at a task and you still have time to work on it.
