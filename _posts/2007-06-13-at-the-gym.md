Every now and again you see the instructors filling in the new starters with the workout jargon which I am sure majority do not understand. They never give you any information on nutrition like what you should eat and what you should avoid because in my opinion a good body is a mix of good food and good workout. I have seen people neglecting the technique and just pushing the weight with no routine whatsoever.<br>

 In my opinion with every gym membership the member should be given a book on nutrition and a book on effective workouts. The whole point is to arouse their interest...to motivate them to become interested and more importantly sustain their interest over a longer period to notice the changes.
