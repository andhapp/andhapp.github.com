---

Recently, I discovered am amazing wordpress plugin for putting a [gist](<http://gist.gihub.com>) in your blog. I am sure people who are here know what gist is?

Anyways, there is this amazing plugin and the installation details are on the creators blog. Here's the [link](<http://www.entropytheblog.com/blog/2008/12/wordpress-github-gist-shortcode-plugin/>) go and install it on your wordpress blog. It is so easy to use, just do

```
[gist id=/id/]
```

and voila it's done. Cool.
