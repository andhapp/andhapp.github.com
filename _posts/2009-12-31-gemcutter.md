Well, if you work with ruby and rails and you do not know what [Gemcutter](<http://gemcutter.org>) is then its time for you to come out of the rock you have been living under. It is the awesome gem hosting service that has in time replaced rubyforge for good.

And, now I am an official contributor to such a incredible application. Yes, I added a [feature](<http://github.com/andhapp/gemcutter/tree/feature-116>) in and it has been merged into the main production branch due for release very soon. And, I am now sitting along the likes of [Jim Weirich](<http://onestepback.org/>) in the contributors [list](<http://twitter.com/rubygemcutter/contributors>). Awesome.
