title: BBC Snippets
---

Back in 2010, I had the opportunity of working at BBC with an outstanding and innovating group of people. I worked on a project called, BBC Snippets. From its humble beginnings as a Rails project built on sphinx to micro-services built on top of solr, it was the most satisfying and fun project I've ever worked on. To top it all, it was solving a real issue. It reduced the researching and creating snippets time down to a few minutes.

Well, now you can listen to all this from the guy who has been [working on it from the start.](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVcjXdF3Sa0>)

Hope you enjoy it!
