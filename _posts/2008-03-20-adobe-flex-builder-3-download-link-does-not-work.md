title: Adobe Flex Builder 3 download link does not work
---

What a discouraging start to <span class="shw">Adobe Flex <span class="shw">faddism. I meticulously tried the link on this page (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=flex3email">Download Flex Builder 3</a>) several times but it just does not work...I will try it on a different computer and see what happens.<br></span></span>
