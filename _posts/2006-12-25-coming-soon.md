Completely revamped version of [andhapp.com](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/>) will be unleashed in the coming days. This is my **first honest attempt** at designing a web page. I will take this opportunity to give credits to:

1. Prettyforms (helped in reducing the hideousness of the HTML Forms) by [Agave group](http://www.agavegroup.com/?p=35)

2. Exciting javascripts (helped in achieving the slick effects) by [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/) that minimised my work...which otherwise would have been a Yeoman's task.

Last but by no means least...my CSS knowledge (although quite basic) was quite handy in putting it altogether.

Many Thanks
