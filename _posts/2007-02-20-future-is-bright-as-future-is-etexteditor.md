title: Future is bright Future is ETextEditor
---

No denying you will be absolutely gobsmacked by this text editor which is Windows equivalent of Mac's text mate...and the features are sweet...so powerful. My earlier choice of text editor EditPlus2 just looks feeble to me now...

Some of its features are:<br>

 1) Select different words by pressing the Ctrl key down and then edit them simultaneously.

2) Complete auto completion facility for several programming languages like Rails and so on.

3) Execute Unix commands on the files in the context like doing a grep on the file to match certain expression.

and there are many more....so go on and unleash the power...here's the [website](<http://www.e-texteditor.com/>) link to download. Watch the screencasts and check out some of its features.
