title: Ashes Hope burnt to ashes
---

As we all cricket followers know England [lost poorly](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/6206590.stm>)...yes and they did not go down fighting. Well when England regained the prestigious Ashes last year a comment from an Australian fan appeared in the [Metro](<http://www.metro.co.uk/>) \- "Loosing Ashes felt like waking up one morning with pictures of [Camilla Parker Bowles](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall>) on all the walls around you"

And today I read [Geoffrey Boycott's](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Boycott>) comment - "Aussies can hit the winning runs with a stick of rhubarb"

Funny...isn't it?
