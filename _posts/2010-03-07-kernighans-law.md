title: Kernighan's law

As per Kernighan's law:

***"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."***

What that means for me?<br>

 Either don't write smart code or stop fixing my bugs because I will never be able to. Perfect!
