title: Start a new trend
---

Why are people so uncomfortable to do things differently? I think the only way you can be remarkable is try novel notions. I know it is a big risk but how else are you suppose to find out what works and what does not.

I was speaking to someone last week and they said, yeah they are doing it, so we should do it as well, and I was like No! We should think of another way of doing this. May be we can do it better and more effective, but no one listens to me.

I guess people are just too scared to start a new trend since it is a big risk. But the bigger the risk the better is your prospect of making big...isn't it?
