title: What does Spring bring?
---

For non-programmers, Spring symbolises sunshine, warm breeze and holiday season. However, the story is a little bit different for Programmers. Yes, Spring brings timezone issues for Programmes. In other words, the moment of truth is upon us now and it's time to check your timezone code. I spotted two obvious issues, and both are somewhat related to github. My pull request on rails are showing an hour behind the actual time, and the resque web admin retries the failed jobs an hour before the actual time.

Anyways, just a little Spring warning.
