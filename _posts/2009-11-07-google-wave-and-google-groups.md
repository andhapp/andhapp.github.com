title: Google Wave and Google Groups
---

Isn't Google Wave an extended, better designed and developed version of Google Groups and Google will slowly and shrewdly phase it out? The reason I say that is becuase I have recently signed up for RubyLearning Wave Group and it gives me a feeling that it has been built on top of the same concept as Google groups. How else can one explain the lack of spam management and clunky interface on Google groups?

Now, we all know that Google groups is terrible considering the Web 2.0 standards atleast. I know you would doubt my credibility and therfore you should read [this](<http://ejohn.org/blog/google-groups-is-dead/>) article from John Resig (the Javascript Ninja and the creator of JQuery). I have been managing the [Ruby Shoes](<http://groups.google.com/groups/shoooes>) group for quite some time now and what surprises me is that Google somehow has forgotten to implement the Gmail's "spam controlling" strategy on Google groups.

Anyways, we will see what happens in the future but as it stands Ruby Shoes group has since moved to [librelist](<http://librelist.com/>) and it has worked out well. Lifehacker has done a really nice [post](<http://lifehacker.com/5376138/google-wave-101>) on some Google Wave "not so obvious" features.
