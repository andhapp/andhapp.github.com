Recently saw Vodafone's poster ad which went like:

"Get a hug at work - Free Family minutes on vodafone"

Ok so a family gets free minutes to talk to each other but I was not very convinced by "Get a hug at work".

I am not a Marketing guru but not sure what message were they trying to send out but it looks like some lazy man's work... I am sure they can do better than that.
