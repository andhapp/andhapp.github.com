title: ETextEditor v EditPlus
---

I just realised yesterday a vital advantage of [EditPlus](<http://www.editplus.com/>) on [ETextEditor](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/Future_is_bright_Future_is_ETextEditor/33>) \- Support Regular Expressions.

In [EditPlus](<http://www.editplus.com/>) you can search and replace by [Regular Expressions](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>) which is very handy when you are working on a long text file and would like to do a quick search followed by replace all...but could not find a way to do the same on [ETextEditor](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/Future_is_bright_Future_is_ETextEditor/33>) (something I was expecting).<br>

 Let me know of a way you can do that on [ETextEditor](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/Future_is_bright_Future_is_ETextEditor/33>) bypassing [Regular Expressions](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>) while exploring [ETextEditor's](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/Future_is_bright_Future_is_ETextEditor/33>) features.

I still think they both are great editors and for the time being I will have to keep both installed.
