title: Parallel or Crossover Ethernet cable
---

Yeah, I got asked this question when I had to buy some ethernet cable. It sounds very prehistoric to run a cable in this day and age. Perhaps, that is not the point of this post. So, I was saying that I got asked this questions and I stood their thinking "Are there different types of ethernet cables?". Thanks to "not paying attention" whilst at university. Anyways, that ensued a journey into the world of research.

There are several different types of cables and each fit a specific purpose but I would just discuss two here as they are the most relevant IMHO:

a) Parallel - In a Parallel Ethernet cable, the smaller cables inside the Ethernet cable on both ends will be in the same order of colors, from left to right. It is used to connect the computer to a hub or a router to a switch.

b) Crossover - A Crossover Ethernet cable has different pin points on each side. It can basically reverse the signals the received or transmitted signal. It is used to connect computing devices without the use of a hub or switch.

Right, so which one do I use to connect my computer to a router. Ofcourse, a parallel one. There is a lot of other information related to the ethernet cables and types and standards and if you fancy reading it just google.
