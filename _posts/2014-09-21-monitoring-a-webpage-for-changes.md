title: Monitoring a webpage for changes
---

I have been following [Reconstructing Ruby](<http://www.halogenandtoast.com/reconstructing-ruby-part-3-more-tokens/>) articles to create a Ruby VM from scratch to learn the process of creating a VM and the tools involved. I want a notification when a new article appears on the scene.

**RSS feed?**

I wish I could use RSS for it, but this particular side doesn't have any RSS feeds. Also, the author of these articles updates the page with the links to the next article, so I'd probably need something that checks the page for changes and notifies me of the changes.

**So, you are going to write one yourself, right?**

Not so fast. Luckily, I found a solution on google. [Page monitor chrome extension](<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-monitor/pemhgklkefakciniebenbfclihhmmfcd?hl=en>) not only polls for the changes it also allows the user to configure when and how they want any notifications. I have been using the extension for few weeks now and it works like a charm. Next time you are looking for something similar, give it a try.
