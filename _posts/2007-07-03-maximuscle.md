I am sure you all know about [Maximuscle](<http://www.maximuscle.com/>)...you must have seen the pictures of toned up guys drinking shakes and flaunting their abdominal muscles and in small print it says the name of the guy and their profession and for some reason a lot of them are "software engineers"..seems to me a perfect way to advertise a protein product...

On the other hand and this is quite funny...I saw this guy on the train and the sign on the back of his t-shirt read "Maximuscle" but in real the guy was quite fat with no muscle whatsoeva....now if Maximuscle poses as a protein product it would be helpful to actually ensure the guys who wear it can actually carry the message...looks like bad advertising to me...
