title: My trivial mistake using MySql with Rails
---

Well as you know I did a [fresh installation](<http://www.andhapp.com/blog/Issues_with_webrick_startup/30>) of ruby and rails on my system.

SO I created the database and tried retreving the records from it and for some reason it threw numerous "access denied" errors and it is then I realised that I need to download MySql adapter but still why will it give me "access denied" errors...beyond my intelligence.

For some reason I always thought mysql was part of the rails gems....but I was wrong.

I know it sounds so nooob...
