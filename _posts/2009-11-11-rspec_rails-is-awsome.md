title: rspec_rails is awesome
---

It is only when one has to muck about with other mocking libraries one realises how cool rspec\_rails is? It bascially provides you so much "rails" functionality out of the box that mocking and stubbing feels like a walk in the park. I have been trying some other mocking libraries and just can't get my head around the whole mocking and stubbing thing. Anyways, I will keep trying and hopefully post.
