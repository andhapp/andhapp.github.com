title: The GOD Delusion Review one
---

I bought [Richard Dawkin's ](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins>)book - [The GOD Delusion ](<http://www.amazon.co.uk/God-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0593055489>)on Saturday and thought about doing my own review. Do not worry I am not a great reviewer and I am not going to batter him either. I believe in the existence of GOD and I totally appreciate his opinion and by the way this is an opportunity for me to learn what others think about GOD. Criticism is not my aim I would rather promote a healthy discussion.

What I liked:

He mentions in the Preface section on page 3 he condemns the use of phrases like "Catholic child" and I completely comprehend where he is coming from. At a young age children are naive and will not understand these terms just like any other thing like Politics and so on.

What I disliked:

On page 1 of Preface he is blaming religion for the killings around the world. However, in my opinion no religion ever encourages innocent killings. There are groups of people who for their own petty egoistic motives endorse these acts of abhorrence. These groups have notoriously misconstrued the essence of religion.
