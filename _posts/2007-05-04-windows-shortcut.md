Let us say you are going through a long listing of folders and would like to see what is in these folders but do not want leave the current view. This leaves you with only one option of opening these folders one by one but in a different window. In order to achieve that press the **"Ctrl key and then double click the folder**" this will open it in a new window and you can still have the current view open.
