title: 'Pow doesn''t work after upgrade to Yosemite '

> The last horse finally crosses the finish line.

Yes, I finally upgraded to Yosemite. Unfortunately, Pow didn't take the upgrade kindly and decided to spew out a cryptic error message. Apparently, there was an issue with Pow on Yosemite but had been fixed a while back. So, I reinstalled the latest version with a hope it would fix it but that didn't fix it either.

The trick is to uninstall pow and then reinstall from scratch to be able to use it again on Yosemite.

Hope it helps.
